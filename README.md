    Flexibility: Prioritizes rapid iteration and flexibility.
    Self-Organizing Teams: Product management teams allocate resources.
    Value Delivery: Focuses on delivering value quickly.
While
Waterfall:
    Approach: Linear and sequential.
    Phases: Well-defined stages (requirements, design, development, testing, etc.).
    Hand-offs: Formalized hand-offs between stages.
    Completion: Each stage lasts until completion.
    Management: Top-down oversight.
    Documentation: Detailed documentation.
    Use Cases: Large projects with clear requirements.

While 
Agile
        Approach: Incremental and iterative.
    Sprints: Time-based bursts of activity (typically 1-4 weeks).
    Flexibility: Prioritizes rapid iteration and flexibility.
    Self-Organizing Teams: Product management teams allocate resources.
    Value Delivery: Focuses on delivering value quickly.
    Use Cases: Smaller pieces for continuous progress.

Scenarios which each might be preferred:
For Waterfall:
    Scenario: Well-defined, stable requirements.
    Advantages: Clear structure, detailed planning, and comprehensive documentation.
    Drawbacks: Less adaptable to changes, longer timeframes.
    Examples: Large-scale infrastructure projects, regulatory compliance systems.
while 
For Agile:
    Scenario: Dynamic, evolving requirements.
    Advantages: Flexibility, faster feedback, adaptive responses.
    Drawbacks: Requires active stakeholder involvement, less formal documentation.
    Examples: Web development, mobile apps, startups, where agility is crucial.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Answer:
Requirement Engineering involves identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

And the Inportance include:
RE ensures that software projects start on the right track by meticulously defining, documenting, and validating requirements, it sets 
    the foundation for successful development.
RE captures stakeholder needs, including both functional and non-functional requirements. These inputs guide the development process, 
    ensuring that the final software aligns with user expectations.
RE  Errors or misunderstandings in requirements can be costly if detected later in the development cycle. RE helps identify potential risks
    early, reducing the chances of expensive rework.

Software Design Principles:
Software design principles are fundamental guidelines that facilitate the creation of well-structured and maintainable software systems. These 
    principles enhance code quality, readability, reusability, and scalability. 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Answer:
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a complex software system into smaller, independent modules. Each module 
    perfom a specific function or handles a particular feature, and they interact through well-defined interfaces.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Answer:
Software testing involves verifying and validating a software application.
    It ensures that the software:
    Is free of bugs.
    Meets technical requirements set during design and development.
    Satisfies user requirements effectively.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing 
crucial in software development?
Answer:
Unit Testing:
    Focuses on individual components (units) of the software.
    Verifies if each unit functions correctly in isolation.
    Detects errors within specific functions or methods.
Integration Testing:
    Tests the interaction between multiple units or modules.
    Ensures that integrated components work together as expected.
    Detects interface errors and data flow issues.
System Testing:
    Evaluates the entire software system as a whole.
    Tests both functional and non-functional requirements.
    Verifies that the system meets specified criteria.
    Includes end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security testing
Acceptance Testing:
    Ensures that the software meets user requirements.
    Conducted before delivery to users.
    Validates that the software works correctly in the userâ€™s environment.
    Confirms compliance with specifications or 
    
Testing is crucial in software development because it helps in Bug detection, risk management, validation of requirements e.t.c.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Answer:
Version Control System are software tools that help track and manage changes to software code over time.
important of version control system in software developemrnt;
The importance in software engineering include the following 
    VCS enables teams to work together efficiently, even across different locations.
    By recording every change, VCS helps prevent code corruption and unintended errors.
    If issues arise, it allows reverting to a stable version
    It accommodates parallel development, feature branches, and merging.
    VCS provides a historical record of changes, aiding in debugging and auditing.
    Developers can understand why specific decisions were made.

Version of control system include :
Git:
    Open-source and distributed: Git allows decentralized collaboration among developers.
    Web-based platform for Git: GitHub provides hosting, collaboration, and code review features.
Mercurial:
    Fast and powerful distributed control: Mercurial is similar to Git but simpler.
    Branching and merging: It handles branching and merging with ease

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Answer:
The role of a software project manager is crusial in software engineering as there reponsibities include Project planning, Project managing and control, team coordination, handling risk and unexpected event during development,Bridging technical teams and stakeholders, ensuring information flow,Maintaining software quality from inception to completion. The role is a very crucial one as it serves as an overseer over other team memebers and deliver software that meets client requirements.

The responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects includdes:
    Define project goals, requirements, and scope.
    Establish a clear roadmap for development
    Allocate resources (people, time, budget) effectively.
    Identify and mitigate risks.
    Address unexpected issues promptly.
    Track and adjust project plan when needed in the project process
    Keep stakeholders informed

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Answer:
Software maintenance involves modifying and updating software after its initial release to ensure it remains functional, reliable, and  
    relevant
Preventative Maintenance:
    Proactively prevents future problems, Addresses latent faults (small issues that may escalate),Ensures long-term stability and performance,
Perfective Maintenance: 
    Enhances software functionality, Adds new features, improves usability, and optimizes performance
Corrective Maintenance: Addresses faults and errors in the software, Swiftly resolves issues reported by users or detected during testing,
    enhances reliability and user satisfaction.

Maintainance is essential as part of software lifecycle because it ensures the long-term health and effectiveness of a software systems.
